# Original KML File Data
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection makes certain data available on-line 
at <https://www.maine.gov/dep/gis/datamaps/>.   Among those data, the site 
exposes GIS data on stream and wetland biomonitoring via a `KML` file, 
`lawb_biomonitoring.kml`.

This file was downloaded by Curtis C. Bohlen on November 14, 2020.  THe metadata on
the DEP web site stated the file was current as of (7/16/2020).

## File Structure
This KML file consists principally of <NetworkLink> tags pointing to other 
online resources.  Many of these appear to be KMZ files containing similar
data, organized in different ways for display purposes. Two may be of
interest for our purposes:

### Sample ID
https://www.maine.gov/dep/gis/datamaps/lawb_biomonitoring/lawb_biomonitoring_sample_id.kmz

### Major Drainage
https://www.maine.gov/dep/gis/datamaps/lawb_biomonitoring/lawb_biomonitoring_major_drainage.kmz

These were downloaded by Curtis C. Bohlen on November 15, 2020.
